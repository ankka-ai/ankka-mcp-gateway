# Live harnesses

For the normal provider integration loop, use the root command:

```sh
npm run test:live -- --config /private/provider-test.json
```

Read `ANKKA_LIVE_TOKEN` from your credential store into the process environment.
The config is a mode-0600 JSON file outside the checkout:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "accountId": "<test account id>",
  "zoneId": "<test zone id>",
  "zoneName": "test.example.com",
  "adminEmail": "operator@example.com",
  "manifest": "/private/candidate/manifest.json",
  "runDirectory": "/private/new-provider-run"
}
```

Use a new run directory each time; its parent must exist. The command selects
only `provider-cycle.live.ts`. It creates disposable Portal, Access and DNS
resources through the current production bootstrap code, verifies the ready
receipt, then uses the production uninstall payload to verify removal. The
operator token needs the same provider permissions as the existing Stage 2
harness. It does not need interactive OAuth or a browser profile.

Console diagnostics contain method, API family, HTTP status and duration.
Exact receipts and storage checkpoints remain in a private mode-0700 directory;
never commit or upload that directory. No token is written to the record.
After a cleanup failure, retry the recorded cleanup with:

```sh
npm run test:live -- --config /private/provider-test.json --cleanup
```

A partial installation without a ready receipt requires inspection of the
private checkpoints; the command does not guess ownership or delete resources
by name. A killed process leaves `run.lock`: confirm the original process has
stopped before removing that lock to recover. Never start a fresh run over an
existing record.

This is a provider API test with a local storage stand-in. It does **not**
validate Worker deployment, Durable Object persistence, signed updates, browser
login or OAuth consent, and it never marks the full lifecycle qualified. Use
`validate:lifecycle:live` for the separately documented deployed checks. Keep
focused local tests as the fastest default; run this when changing provider
behavior. It is deliberately excluded from ordinary CI.

## Specialized harnesses

Real Cloudflare calls against a dedicated test account. Never part of
`npm run check`; run one explicitly from `apps/installer`:

```
ANKKA_LIVE_TOKEN=<api token, read from a keychain into this process only> \
ANKKA_LIVE_ACCOUNT_ID=<account id> ANKKA_LIVE_ZONE_ID=<zone id> \
ANKKA_LIVE_ZONE_NAME=<zone> ANKKA_LIVE_ADMIN_EMAIL=<admin email> \
ANKKA_LIVE_PREFIX=harness1 ANKKA_LIVE_MANIFEST=<candidate manifest.json> \
npx vitest run --config vitest.live.config.ts test-live/stage2-bootstrap.live.ts
```

`stage2-bootstrap.live.ts` builds a real plan for `mcp<prefix>.<zone>`, runs
the Stage 2 converger's bootstrap request into the shipped payload in-process
with the API token instead of the OAuth grant, verifies the receipt the way
the converger does, traces every provider call (method, path, status,
duration; never tokens or bodies) and removes what the payload recorded.

Optional: `ANKKA_LIVE_PAYLOAD=<path>` runs a different payload module (for
example an instrumented copy); `ANKKA_LIVE_KEEP=1` leaves the created
resources in place. The token needs the zone's DNS edit permission besides
Access, AI controls and Workers edit rights.

`stage2-full.live.ts` runs the whole install path in token mode: hosted
Stage 1 provisions the real shell Worker from a local publish directory
(read the way the hosted runtime reads R2, signature and all), completes the
handoff against it with the same readiness poll, then the Stage 2 converger
runs in this process against the real provider with the shipped payload
in-process, using an issuer key generated for the run. Only the two OAuth
endpoints and the account list are answered locally, so the API token stands
in for the grant. Needs `ANKKA_LIVE_PUBLISH_DIR` (the signer's publish
directory) and `ANKKA_LIVE_PIN` (its pin.json) beside the variables above.
The converger runs with the shell's checkpoints, one pass per call the way
the shell runs one pass per Durable Object alarm, and the harness prints and
bounds the provider calls of every pass: a Workers Free account allows 50
subrequests per invocation, and this is the only place the payload's own
provider calls are counted. Cleanup removes the payload's recorded
resources, the management application, the custom domain, marker-tagged
DNS records and the Worker. It does not cover the OAuth grant itself; that
still needs a consent.

`runtime-update.live.ts` runs the gateway's own updater
(`customer-runtime-update.ts`) from this process against a real installed
Worker, with the API token standing in for the `upgrade` grant and the
journal replaced by a log. It downloads the pinned release from the control
plane, verifies it, uploads the assets and the new version with the existing
secrets inherited, and leaves that Worker running the pinned release with its
journal untouched; use it on a test install only. Extra env:
`ANKKA_LIVE_WORKER_NAME`, `ANKKA_LIVE_TARGET_RELEASE`,
`ANKKA_LIVE_TARGET_SHA256` (with its `sha256:` prefix),
`ANKKA_LIVE_UPDATE_KEY_ID`, `ANKKA_LIVE_UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY`.
