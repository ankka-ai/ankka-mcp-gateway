# Source visibility and live canaries

This document records the boundary for two optional post-preview capabilities.
The operator-run live Portal runner described below is implemented, but
no gateway deployment or live result is part of this repository. The
gateway supports `read_only` and `read_write` declarations, with exact tool
allowlists and independent upstream enforcement. Connected MCP servers can expose
explicitly selected edit tools; see [source capabilities](SOURCE_CAPABILITIES.md).

For the current founding-team dogfood deployment, one Access group and manual
health/catalogue checks are sufficient. Multiple visibility partitions,
scheduled machine identities, and exact actor correlation are deferred until a
present product need justifies them. Read and edit tools use the existing source
assignments and exact tool selection rather than a new permissions system.

## Readiness summary

| Capability | Current state | Remaining gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-source Access groups | Implemented and optional; one group is enough for current dogfood | Live qualification only when a deployment actually needs more than one visibility audience |
| Connected MCP write tools | Supported through explicit tool selection and upstream permissions | Verify the intended provider grant and behavior before enabling a real operation |
| Scheduled live-source canary | Optional standalone bounded runner implemented; synthetic transport tests pass | Operator-owned scheduling and sink only if manual qualification stops being sufficient |

## Per-source Access groups

The founding-team deployment uses one group. The machinery below remains a
generic optional capability; it is not a reason to create sensitivity
partitions or additional groups for the current BLS source.

Cloudflare enforces Access selectors, including Groups, on MCP server
applications reached through a Portal. The implemented contract is documented
in [Per-source Cloudflare Access groups](SOURCE_ACCESS_GROUPS.md).

An optional source `accessGroup` carries an operator-chosen exact logical name.
Immediately before plan, readback, and apply, the caller must freshly enumerate
Cloudflare groups with operator-owned authority and supply an ephemeral
`groups: [{id,name}]` observation snapshot. The offline planner does not fetch
that snapshot. It binds the logical name only when exactly one observation
matches and blocks missing, malformed, or ambiguous mappings without falling
back to the Portal-wide email audience.

A bound source receives a default-deny Allow policy with exactly one
`{group:{id}}` include selector. Sources without `accessGroup` retain the prior
email behavior, and the Portal policy always remains email-based. Plans expose
only the identity type, count, and stable digest; receipts retain the policy
identity digest, not provider group IDs or membership. Provider mutation
rebuilds the expected policy from the current config and snapshot before any
write, while readback treats a changed ID, extra selector, or extra nested field
as drift.

Synthetic config, planner, receipt, provider-mutation, and drift tests cover
the contract. This repository does not claim a live Cloudflare qualification:
the operator must still verify multiple groups, one user in each relevant
group, and a user in no group in its own account. Caller-side group enumeration
and any hosted UI that constructs the snapshot remain external integrations.

Group names, tool names, and prompts are not authorization. The upstream source
must still reject operations outside the caller's actual authority.

## Read and edit access

Connected MCP sources can expose read and edit tools. Existing tool selections
and upstream grants are preserved on update. Each source's assigned people can
use its selected tools; there is no separate read/edit role or per-call approval
workflow. Tool hints do not establish permission or classify an operation safely.

Use a separate source and upstream identity when different people need different
authority. Dedicated readers, including `bls-read`, retain their read-only
credentials and catalogues. Agent-authored API sources and provider-specific
read-only bridges are not widened by this change. The current operation risks
and qualification boundary are documented in [source capabilities](SOURCE_CAPABILITIES.md).

## Operator-run live canary

<a id="customer-owned-live-canary"></a>

A live canary must not sample arbitrary business tools. Each source should
expose one dedicated read-only health tool with fixed synthetic output, no
arguments that select private records, and no provider credential or response
content. The same operation must be safe to repeat.

The scheduled runner should live in the team's account or monitoring
system and use a dedicated machine identity. Its Portal and every target source
need matching least-privilege Access Service Auth policies. The gateway
does not expose general machine-identity policy configuration. The separate
[operator disposable canary](CANARY_PROFILES.md) can create exact Service Auth
policies only for its fixed synthetic source; it is not this gateway monitoring
runner and does not qualify Code Mode or human OAuth.

The standalone runner is implemented in
[`tools/live-portal-canary.mjs`](../tools/live-portal-canary.mjs). It makes three
stateless MCP `2026-07-28` JSON-RPC operations: list the Portal surface, search
for one exact sanitized Code Mode identifier, and execute that identifier with
an empty object. It does not create a service token, change an Access policy,
inspect Portal logs, schedule itself, or export to a monitoring sink. Those
gateway operations and the first live result remain external qualification.

The JSON configuration can live inside or outside this repository and has one
strict, secret-free shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "portalUrl": "https://portal.example.com/mcp",
  "healthToolIdentifier": "bls_read_ankka_canary_status",
  "arguments": {},
  "expectedCanonicalResultSha256": "sha256:ccf234692f2ac6ca25aacd6fb331d57cd619c7859fdb5b4d9922bf063f46fa2c"
}
```

That example digest is for the fixed JSON value
`{"fixture":"ankka-live-canary","ok":true,"version":1}`. Canonicalization
recursively sorts object keys, preserves array order, emits compact JSON, and
hashes its UTF-8 bytes. Configure the digest from the health tool's reviewed,
synthetic constant; do not derive it by printing a live business response.
`arguments` must be exactly `{}`. Unknown configuration fields, URL query
parameters, non-HTTPS URLs, and non-sanitized identifiers are rejected.

Derive the example digest offline from that reviewed synthetic constant:

```sh
node --input-type=module -e 'import { canonicalResultSha256 } from "./tools/live-portal-canary.mjs"; const value = { fixture: "ankka-live-canary", ok: true, version: 1 }; process.stdout.write(`${canonicalResultSha256(value)}\n`);'
```

Replace only the `value` literal with the exact constant returned by the
team's health tool. This command does not make a network request.

The exact Portal URL must end at `/mcp` without a query or fragment. Therefore,
configure the Portal's Code Mode policy as `default_on` or `enforced`; the
runner does not append an opt-in query. Put the service-token values only in the
runner environment, then invoke:

```sh
export CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID
export CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET
npm run canary:live -- --config /absolute/path/to/live-portal-canary.json
```

The runner reads no other credential input. It sends those two values only as
the Cloudflare Access service-token headers to the exact configured origin,
uses no cookie or MCP session, and rejects redirects. Provider credentials are
not part of this flow. Each request has a seven-second timeout; the complete run
has a twenty-second deadline. Configuration, individual responses, aggregate
responses, the canonical health value, result depth, and the Portal tool count
all have fixed local bounds.

Standard output is exactly one small JSON record. It contains only a status,
fixed code, timestamps, and phase latencies; it never contains the URL, tool
identifier, Code Mode program, call arguments, response, credential, email, or
exception text. A successful shape is:

```json
{"schemaVersion":1,"status":"passed","code":"ok","startedAt":"2026-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","finishedAt":"2026-08-29T00:00:01.000Z","latenciesMs":{"total":1000,"list_tools":100,"search":300,"execute":600}}
```

Any non-`ok` fixed code exits nonzero. Send this content-free record only to a
operator-owned monitoring sink.

One run should verify:

1. Portal authentication succeeds for the canary identity.
2. Code Mode advertises `portal_codemode_search` and
   `portal_codemode_execute`, plus only the reviewed Portal-native management
   tools, with no upstream tool exposed directly.
3. Search finds the dedicated health tool by its exact sanitized identifier.
4. Execute returns the fixed synthetic response whose canonical digest matches
   the configured SHA-256.
5. Portal logs contain the expected identity, source, tool, success, and
   duration fields.
6. The result is exported only to the team's monitoring sink.

Store only the runner's bounded JSON record. Do not store tool arguments,
results, tokens, cookies, raw provider errors, user emails, private data, or
source credentials in the dashboard canary record. A failure should alert the
operator; it must not send telemetry to Ankka.

Canary execution stays read-only. Update and rollback drills remain separate,
explicitly approved lifecycle operations.

## Cloudflare reference

Cloudflare owns the Portal source-visibility and Access-selector behavior
assumed by this roadmap. Revalidate it before each live qualification:
