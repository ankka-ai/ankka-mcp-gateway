# Team access

Team reads current Cloudflare membership and displays its observation time.
With the [customer-owned management token](MANAGEMENT_TOKEN.md) configured,
administrators save source assignments directly in the gateway. The token stays
in your Cloudflare account. Administrator identities remain fixed, and new
sources start denied to everyone until an explicit Team grant.

A missing credential leaves the saved snapshot available, clearly unverified.
Provider failures or unexpected policy shapes block verified reads and writes.
Refresh before editing after an external change; stale revisions are rejected.
An interrupted save retains its exact proposal and write journal for explicit
resume. Do not replace it with a different proposal or delete its state.

The manual procedures below remain useful for provider-side inspection and
session revocation. Historical canary observations are not proof that the new
account-token flow has been qualified live.

## Revocation qualification

Removing an email from a source policy does not by itself prove that an
already-connected client has lost access. Canary qualification keeps Portal
admission and the operator's source access unchanged while removing only the
test member's source assignment:

| Connection | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Existing Portal grant | Direct and Code Mode calls still succeeded more than five minutes after the policy removal was verified. |
| Fresh client authorization started after removal | The browser stopped at **No allowed servers available** before issuing an OAuth code or token. |
| Existing grant refreshed after removal | Refreshes at 15, 60, 180, and 300 seconds succeeded; source discovery and direct and Code Mode reads still worked. |

The fresh-client result proves admission denial, not a tool-call test using a
new token. These observations do not establish a provider defect or indefinite
access. Cloudflare marks
[email selectors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/#cloudflare-access-selectors)
as checked at login, not continuously. The
[Portal authorization grant](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/#session-lifecycle)
retains authentication, server selection, and upstream OAuth state.

Cloudflare's
[Managed OAuth documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/managed-oauth/#managed-oauth-settings)
says Access policies are reevaluated on refresh, but does not explicitly define
whether refreshing Portal admission reevaluates every linked source policy.
Do not infer a source-access expiry bound from the Portal access-token lifetime.

### Qualified procedure for existing Portal sessions

A separate canary test removed the member's source assignment and then invoked
Cloudflare's application-token revocation for the exact Portal application.
The same client had first passed source discovery and harmless reads:

- At the first check, 15 seconds after Cloudflare accepted revocation, the old
  access token received HTTP 401 for both `tools/list` and `tools/call`, in
  direct mode and Code Mode.
- A refresh attempt 90 seconds after revocation received HTTP 400
  `invalid_grant`; no replacement access token was issued.
- The original source assignment was restored after the test, and both source
  and Portal policies were read back and verified.

This qualifies application-token revocation for the tested Portal workflow.
The observed timing is not a propagation guarantee. Restoring a source policy
does not restore revoked client credentials.

When you need to remove existing access:

1. Remove the person's assignment from the relevant source policy and verify
   the saved audience. For departure from the team, also remove Portal admission.
2. Identify the exact Portal Access application from the installation receipt.
   Cloudflare's
   [application-token revocation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/access/subresources/applications/methods/revoke_tokens/)
   uses `POST /accounts/{account_id}/access/apps/{app_id}/revoke_tokens`.
   **This revokes every session for that Portal**, including other team members;
   account for their need to reconnect before invoking it.
3. Verify that the previously authorized client cannot list or call source
   tools, and that its refresh token cannot renew access. Verify that a fresh
   authorization cannot select the removed source. A successful revocation API
   response alone is not proof of denied access.

Cloudflare also documents
[user session revocation across applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/#revoke-user-sessions).
That broader operation was not tested. The qualified application-level
procedure does not establish a way to revoke only one person's session for one
source. A source policy update alone must not promise immediate disconnection.

## Why V1 does not use an API token

Cloudflare support confirmed that both account-owned (`cfat_...`) and user-owned
API tokens can select resources only at User, Account, or Zone level. An API
token with **Access: Policies Write** for one account can therefore update every
Access policy in that account. It cannot be restricted to the reusable policy
owned by one Ankka installation.

Per-policy **Cloudflare Access Policy Admin** scoping exists in Cloudflare's
human/member IAM model. Cloudflare also confirmed that this resource-scoped
role is still beta for OAuth: individual policy API requests can currently be
evaluated differently from the resource-scoped list endpoints. That provider
gap explains the qualified `403`; widening the grant or substituting an
account-wide token would not preserve the intended isolation.

The V1 decision is therefore to keep the editor disabled instead of presenting
account-wide authority as policy-scoped.

## No V1 Team credential

Do not create an API token for the gateway Team page and do not add a Team
management secret to the Worker. The normal release contract does not declare,
inherit, or consume one. Adding an undeclared secret manually does not enable
Team editing.

The management dashboard authenticates administrators through Cloudflare
Access, but that browser session is not authority for the Worker to rewrite
Access policies. V1 does not fall back to a hosted Team OAuth flow.

## Manage membership in Cloudflare

Use the Cloudflare dashboard to change the reusable Access policies protecting
the Ankka Portal and installed source applications. Keep the following
boundaries intact:

1. Confirm you are in the exact account that owns the gateway.
2. Identify the receipt-owned Ankka Access applications and reusable policies;
   do not select resources by a similar display name alone.
3. Preserve the fixed gateway administrators and review each source audience
   explicitly. Joining the team must not imply access to every source.
4. Keep an unassigned source default-deny. Do not replace an empty audience with
   an Allow-everyone or Bypass policy.
5. Do not change the Portal's shared tool allowlists or upstream authentication
   while performing a membership-only change.
6. Verify one intended identity and one denied identity with harmless read-only
   calls. Hiding a tool from a list is not enforcement proof.

The gateway checks membership at the displayed observation time. It cannot
promise continuously fresh state or represent the effective permissions of an
already-connected client.

## Recovery and lifecycle limits

Keep original receipts and pending write journals. Resume only the exact
recorded change after restoring the token or reconciling unexpected provider
state. An ambiguous write is not undone by revoking its credential. Lifecycle
floors continue to block incompatible rollback and legacy removal paths.

The retired `ANKKA_TEAM_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN` binding is not reused. Revoke any old
preview token and remove its binding. See [Upgrade boundary](TEAM_UPGRADE.md)
for the new contract and fresh-install requirement.

## Session and acceptance limits

An Access policy change is not a promise that every existing session terminates
immediately. Test a fresh session and an already-connected session over a
bounded observation window, and report the delay observed. Application-token
revocation and user revocation have broader effects and are not substitutes for
a narrowly reviewed person/source policy change.

Keep real identities, account and policy IDs, source results, authorization
URLs, and credentials out of repository fixtures and support evidence.
