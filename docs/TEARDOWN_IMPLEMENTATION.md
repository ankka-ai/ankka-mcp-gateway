# Automated teardown implementation

Automated teardown is required for the first stable release. This document
tracks the replacement for the retired hosted management flow. It describes
the implemented flow and the live qualification still required before release.

## Implemented boundaries

The current teardown executor has separate internal prepare, proof, and apply
routes. Its action record binds the `receipt_owned` policy interpretation.
Existing hosted teardown handoffs retain their original restrictions and cannot
select the new interpretation.

The executor rederives the immutable installation and source receipts before
using their provider locators. An Access policy can have a different email or
team group assignment, including the supported deny-everyone state, while
retaining its exact marked name and recorded parent. Full removal is not
prepared while a team still has an Access group, because removal does not
delete team groups. Receipt hashes are never rewritten to
make live policy changes appear original. Applications with an unrecorded
policy, changed destinations, renamed resources, and servers used by another
Portal stop teardown before deletion. The complete graph is checked first;
application policies and server sharing are checked again before the relevant
delete. These reads cannot provide an atomic lock against simultaneous manual
changes in Cloudflare.

The current removal order deletes the Portal graph before its source servers.
This avoids depending on a Portal mapping that Cloudflare may remove when a
server disappears. Each deletion is armed durably first. A lost response is
resolved by reading the exact resource on a new authorization; proven absence
advances the journal without another delete. Unfinished source or runtime work
blocks preparation. A current teardown action blocks runtime updates, and the
existing source lifecycle checks block source changes. Compatibility floors
remain unchanged.

A distinct signed handoff binds the ownership certificate, removal action,
ready-receipt checksum, dependency-graph hash, and the management resource
locators recorded during installation. Its signer requires the adopted gateway
key and the verified installation journal. Import checks the pinned ownership
issuer, signature, purpose, exact management hostname, and ten-minute expiry.
The handoff contains neither an OAuth grant nor a signing key.

The hosted removal job model consumes each OAuth callback once and records a
fixed prefix of root-removal steps. An uncertain send stays pending until a
fresh consent permits exact read-back; the same attempt cannot send it again.
The accepted handoff is reverified at its original import time, allowing an
existing job to resume after the handoff's import window closes. A new job
cannot import an expired handoff. An interrupted token exchange or unconfirmed
revocation remains an explicit warning even if a later consent finishes removal.
The hosted job is stored in a separate SQLite Durable Object with atomic revision checks. Its original handoff, release identity, retirement module digest, and verified progress cannot be replaced or rewound.

## Browser and provider flow

Settings keeps the public `POST /api/teardown-actions` contract and returns a
fragment handoff to `/__ankka/operation/teardown` on the gateway itself. This
review page requires an explicit action before starting Cloudflare consent.
The certified final runtime selects the current internal executor; neither a
browser flag nor an old hosted handoff can select it.

The gateway derives the uninstall scopes from checksum-verified resource kinds.
Its callback atomically consumes a durable attempt before exchanging the code,
probes the expected account using that grant, and executes dependency removal.
Only the installation object's completed removal result supplies the original
receipt checksum and dependency-graph digest used in the signed handoff. The
current grant must be revoked before that handoff is signed. A rejected or
interrupted attempt retains the deletion boundary and permits fresh consent.
Settling an attempt releases lifecycle locks only when the installation object
proves that no deletion was armed: its journal holds no removed resource and no
pending DELETE. This includes an apply that stopped at an ownership check before
its first deletion; the installation object returns to its ready receipt and
drops its pass progress. Unknown or partial removal stays locked.
An earlier unconfirmed revocation remains in the signed handoff even when a
later grant was revoked successfully.

Management Access and the management custom domain remain available during
this first phase. The hosted `/teardown` page imports the signed handoff into a
durable job before offering its own fresh consent. It exposes progress and a
downloadable signed recovery receipt. Reimporting the exact saved receipt can
resume an existing job after its ten-minute import window or the browser cookie
has expired. A fresh signed handoff for the same certificate, locators, and
completed dependency graph can reopen that same job; it cannot change authority
or erase progress. No new job accepts an expired handoff.

### The way back into an interrupted removal

The receipt crosses from the gateway to the hosted page in one browser hop. A
closed tab, a network failure, or a hop that arrives after the ten-minute
window loses it, and only a fresh consent on the gateway signs another. The
gateway's records keep answering once the dependencies are gone: `/api/status`,
`/api/sources`, `/api/source-actions` and `/api/update` read Durable Object
storage only. `/api/team` answers `503 team_unavailable` when a management
token is configured, because it reads the deleted policies; the dashboard
already treats that as a page-level failure.

The dashboard learns the state from routes that exist for other reasons. The
`/api/source-actions` snapshot points at the recorded removal action
(`blockingAction.kind` is `teardown`), and `GET /api/teardown-actions/<id>`
gives its status. `applying` inside its authorization window is a removal that
is still running. `applying` past that window, `gateway_removed` and
`recovery_required` are a removal that has begun, or may have, and needs a
fresh consent; the settlement records `failed` only when the installation
object proves that no deletion was armed. For these the dashboard
shows **Removal in progress** on every page with one action, **Continue
removing this gateway**, which posts `/api/teardown-actions` and opens the
removal page exactly as Settings does. The same notice replaces the load
failure screen when the dashboard cannot load, and the action needs no status
read. The fresh consent rechecks the recorded graph, finds the removed
resources absent, and signs a new receipt handoff.

The notice has two sources. The recorded action says whether an attempt runs
right now. The installation object's own durable record says whether deletion
has begun at all: the source-actions answer carries it as `removalStarted`,
read from `status-current`. The settle step asks the same object through
`settle-current`, which first returns an attempt that armed no deletion to the
ready receipt, so `removalStarted` reads `false` again afterwards. The journal
alone is not enough, because a newer review that is never authorized replaces
an expired record and then expires itself, after which the journal names no
removal although the connected resources are gone. While an earlier
authorization is still open the gateway refuses another with
`teardown_action_conflict`.

The hosted page answers a refusal that no reload can change with its own word
and message instead of the reload guidance: `teardown_receipt_expired` for a
receipt that verifies except for its closed window, with the management
hostname that receipt certifies; `teardown_receipt_rejected` for a receipt that
does not verify or contradicts the accepted job, naming no hostname; and
`teardown_session_missing` when the browser holds no removal. Each says to
authorize the removal again on the gateway's management page. The page does not
expose receipt download or upload controls; signed handoffs remain internal to
the removal flow. Every other failure keeps `teardown_unavailable` and
the reload wording, as does a request that never reached the installer.

The distinct `gateway-root-finalize` operation requests `workers-scripts.write`
and `zone-access.write`. The old Workers-only `uninstall-finalize` and bootstrap
cleanup authorities retain their original scopes. The finalizer verifies the
exact Worker identity and namespace, recorded management application and policy,
and foreign Worker bindings, domains, and policies before the first mutation.
It accepts supported changes to the owned administrator email policy while
refusing additional policies or destinations.

The fixed root order is signed namespace retirement, management custom domain,
management policy, management Access application, and Worker. Retirement uploads
only the exact signed retirement module from the accepted job's pinned release,
with no bindings and a deleted `AdminState` export. The deployed version's module
and configuration are verified before treating namespace retirement as complete.
The job pins the original release so an installer promotion cannot silently
change recovery code. Each destructive boundary is persisted before the request;
only verified provider absence advances progress. Unknown responses require a
fresh consent and read-back, including after the gateway no longer runs. There
is no force-delete option or browser-provided resource list.

The management hostname's placeholder DNS record is not a teardown resource:
the second stage releases it as its own journaled step before attaching the
custom domain and re-proves its absence with the terminal resources, so the
signed handoff, the hosted job and the finalizer carry nothing for it, and
installations journaled before the record existed are removed exactly as
before.

OAuth grants stay in callback-local memory and are revoked and discarded on
success and failure. State, PKCE verifier, and the gateway action key cross the
redirect only in separate encrypted HttpOnly cookies; durable attempts contain
hashes and expiry times. Customer and hosted cookies use distinct encryption
contexts. Provider bodies and credentials are never included in public errors.
Hosted removal jobs retain secret-free authority and progress for recovery;
no expiry alarm deletes them while removal may still need to resume.

## Local verification

Tests exercise the gateway payload with synthetic provider state, including
changed source membership, foreign dependencies, complete removal, immediate
fresh consent, and lost responses at every dependency deletion. Gateway callback
tests cover receipt-derived scopes, rejected grants, callback concurrency,
expiry, revocation, and signing only after verified completion. Hosted tests use
real SQLite, recreated Durable Objects, complete fixed-root removal, failed
revocation, rejected authority, and each uncertain provider mutation. They
also cover each refusal word and its message. The dashboard's real client runs
against the gateway Worker through a complete removal, reading every status
the journal records, and its tests cover the notice, the load-failure screen
and the continued authorization.

## Qualification still required

- Generated installer and gateway artifacts running the complete flow together.
- A disposable live installation with a source and changed membership, complete
  removal with independent absence verification, and an interrupted run resumed
  with fresh consent. No active shared gateway is a disposable test fixture.
